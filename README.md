# SpiralMatrixPrint
A common test for candidates. Here's my take

The concept in this version is to move the 'printing pointer' of x & y
in the correct direction for each portion of the spiral
with only a single concatenation statement.

- Run the Web App. 
- Click the 'Spiral' Menu item
- The first run, on page load, just prints out the array rows.
- Check the 'Ordered' checkbox
- Hit run
- The result is a a string of the Alpabet for most letters that fit into the 5x5 matrix

You can place a breakpoint on line 72 of ~\Contollers\HomeController.cs to follow allong
